# sudoku_ui

This is a project that will provide a ui client for the sudoku solver made here: [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/mjkreul2/sudoku_c/tree/pyinteg). 

Things to do:
- [x] Successfully create and solve a sudoku puzzle 
- [] Create UI interface 
- [x] Create wrapper libraries to more elegantly use the C shared library
- [] Reduce the amount of memory used by library
- [] Figure out how to add C Sudoku Solver to this repo so it is always up to date 
- [] Fix the C repo to be a fork of the old one
